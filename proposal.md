## **Background and Message**
I will be doing a classification/analysis report on law reviews. I will write a shortened law review article about the access to justice problem in Mississippi and possible solutions. It is no secret that private attorneys are expensive. It is difficult for those in the middle class to afford attorneys, so what about those who live at the poverty line? In North Mississippi alone, the latest US Census provides that about 250,000 citizens are at or below the poverty alone, qualifying them for free legal aid at North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. “Equal justice under the law” is engraved on the front of the highest court of the United States, yet it is not practiced. In her book, “Access to Justice,” Deborah L. Rhode claims, “about four-fifths of the civil needs of the poor, and two-thirds of the needs of middle-income individuals, remain unmet.” 

## **Users/Audience**
Access to justice is a nation-wide problem; however my law review article will focus on Mississippi’s access to justice problem. My intended audience includes practicing and hopeful legal professionals. These are the people who can truly make a successful difference in fixing the access to justice problem in the Hospitality State.
