#Background
My law article about the lack of access to justice in Mississippi primarily affects Mississippi residents who cannot afford an attorney, those who do not qualify for free legal services and practicing Mississippi attorneys. My law journal article will be published on the University of Mississippi School of Law website making my main audience focus on law students and legal professionals in Mississippi. Mississippi has several legal service clinics that cannot afford to help each individual above a certain point on the poverty line, so this article will also target them by raising awareness for their need for help. 

#Need
Currently, about 250,000 citizens are at or below the poverty line, meaning the only legal service options they can realistically afford are the free legal clinics set up around the state. These legal clinics are highly effective; in 2016, it is estimated that between the three clinics of the Mississippi Legal Services Coalition, clients and their families benefited $32.4 million. However, the free legal clinics have limited state funding and cannot afford, let alone have the time or workforce, to help all Mississippi citizens that seek their help. North Mississippi Rural Legal Services reported that there is only one legal service attorney for every 21,000 low income individuals who need legal assistance. In 2015, only 15 North Mississippi Rural Legal Service attorneys managed to serve and help 19,893 North Mississippi citizens.

#Variability
This article could also appeal to lawmakers in Mississippi. Because the need for greater access to justice across the state is so imperative, lawmakers could use this topic as a campaign tool. They could even form an official taskforce to propose, try, and implement possible solutions. 

#Barriers to Delivery
This article is targeting Mississippi residents who cannot afford or do not qualify for legal services. It is extremely probable that these residents will not have access to the Internet in order to read this article. Also, private attorneys have little to no incentive to worry about the access to justice problem because their clients can afford legal services. In Mississippi, pro bono public is not strictly enforced. Attorneys have the option to either provide 20 hours of pro bono public work or they can pay a fee of $200 to the Mississippi Bar. If private attorneys can pay that $200, then they are most likely not interested in attempting to help solve the access to justice problem.
